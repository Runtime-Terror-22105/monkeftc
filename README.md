# Monkeftc
some monke ftc code

notes:
- april tag code is using vision portal, while object detection is using opencv. ideally, these should both use visionportal in future, but it is not a priority since we first just need a functional auto
- roadrunner will be used for movement in auto
  - download [rr path gen](https://github.com/Jarhead20/RRPathGen)
  - visualize the path with meepmeep (see the meepmeepvisual folder)
